# E-Commerce-Data-Cleaning-Olist-Dataset

Designed and implemented a Pandas-based data cleaning for the Olist e-commerce dataset, processing 100,000+ records to resolve missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.
Merged and cleaned multi-table e-commerce data using Pandas, reducing missing values by 95%


This project uses the [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?resource=download), available on Kaggle.  
It includes information on orders, products, sellers, and customer reviews from a large Brazilian e-commerce platform.

Used merge, fillna, drop_duplicates, to_datetime, astype, and feature engineering.
Note error handling (e.g., errors='coerce' for dates) to show robustness.
